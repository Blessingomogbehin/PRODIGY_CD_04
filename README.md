IMPLEMENTATION OF A SIMPLE KEYLOGGER FOR ETHICAL PURPOSES
Task Four of my Internship project at Prodigy InfoTech completed.
Just wrote a python code for keylogger, the code was implemented using Python 3.12.3 version.
 
To trace the filelog, I CD on Command prompt > where(the name of the file log I just captured) 
This command displays the file's path, so I could easily trace the captured logfile.

I learnt more on Keylogger and it's useful for ethical purposes.
Keylogger helps capture logs of keystrokes made by a user on a computer keyboard.

For organisations security, it could be used to detect Malicious insiders, such that it captures every keys (words) an employee typed and to enhance Non-repudiation (that an employee can't deny they take a particular action or they wrote a particular message using the company's computer) because the file log would clearly state all done. just as shown in the video....

I also gained more understanding of how to import the keyboard in python. using the following command on Command prompt environment:

CD
where python
python -m ensurepip (this is to install pip) 
python -m pip install keyboard (to install the keyboard library to Python)
